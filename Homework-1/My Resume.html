<h3>City Guide andriod Application</h3>
<p>The goal of the project is to explore how to realize a mobile city guide using the Android platform, including a prototype of the city guide. The project uses the research method Design Science. Through designing and implementing an artifact (i.e. prototype of city guide), the goal of the project is reached. Finally, the project is evaluated in four aspects including platform evaluation, general functional evaluation, scenario evaluation, and non-functional evaluation. </p>
<p>In the project we use integrate current technologies like Google Calendar, Google Map, Browser, Contact application and Phone application into the prototype. As well, the project has investigated non-functional aspects including extendibility, tailor ability, and usability. Overall, the project presents a comprehensive understanding of how to realize city guide on the new mobile platform Android.</p>

<ul>
		<li>Involved in full life cycle of the application including wireframe design, server development and client development.</li>
		<li>Worked on the feature that helps the user identify his current location and the query back-end for finding preferred vendors.
		</li>
		<li>Worked on features that helps the user document a claim
		</li>
		<li>Worked on the feature that helps the user pick up a location and map that with the location of the accident.
		</li>
		<li>Developed the server code in MySQL.
		</li>
		<li>Implemented wrapper classes for sever code and also designed the database tables for all the features in MySQL database.
		</li>
		<li>Created the client codes using JAVA in eclipse SDK3.6.1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Segmentation and Object Recognition Using Edge Detection Techniques</h3>
<p>Image segmentation is the foundation of object recognition and computer vision. In general, image noise should be eliminated through image preprocessing. And there is some specifically given work (such as region extraction and image marking) to do after the main operation of image segmentation for the sake of getting better visual effect. </p>
<p>The result of image segmentation is a set of segments that collectively cover the entire image. All the pixels in region are similar with respect to some characteristic or computed property, such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent regions differ with respect to same characteristics. Edge detection is one of the frequently used techniques in digital image processing.</p>

<h3>Vendor Management System SQL application</h3>
<p>This project Vendor management system will help in standardizing the entire sales &amp; marketing process as it will help in ensuring timely completion of work &amp; also maintain the record of follow-ups that have been done for a particular stage. </p>
<p>Information about each &amp; every company &amp; reseller will be stored in the Database that can be used in future. Each companyâ€™s maturity value can also be calculated for further transactions. In a single go one can have the entire information about any company or reseller.</p>
<p>MS will provide a GUI environment so that one can easily enter the information with the help of forms into the database. By clicking just one button on the form one can generate reports for any pre customer, customer or reseller. The project will address the requirements of keeping the records of all companies as well as resellers and generating the reports on the basis of user requirement</p>
